/// A "folder" is a transformer that can be used to make a copy of
/// some term -- that is, some bit of IR, such as a `Goal` -- with
/// certain changes applied. The idea is that it contains methods that
/// let you swap types/lifetimes for new types/lifetimes; meanwhile,
/// each bit of IR implements the `Fold` trait which, given a
/// `Folder`, will reconstruct itself, invoking the folder's methods
/// to transform each of the types/lifetimes embedded within.
///
/// # Interners
///
/// The Folder trait has two type parameters, `I` and `TI`:
///
/// * `I` is the "source interner" that we are folding *from*
/// * `TI` is the "target interner" that we are folding *into*
///
/// Often, both are the same.
///
/// # Usage patterns
///
/// ## Substituting for free variables
///
/// Most of the time, though, we are not interested in adjust
/// arbitrary types/lifetimes, but rather just free variables (even
/// more often, just free existential variables) that appear within
/// the term.
///
/// For this reason, the `Folder` trait extends two other traits that
/// contain methods that are invoked when just those particular
///
/// In particular, folders can intercept references to free variables
/// (either existentially or universally quantified) and replace them
/// with other types/lifetimes as appropriate.
///
/// To create a folder `F`, one never implements `Folder` directly, but instead
/// implements one of each of these three sub-traits:
///
/// - `FreeVarFolder` -- folds `BoundVar` instances that appear free
///   in the term being folded (use `DefaultFreeVarFolder` to
///   ignore/forbid these altogether)
/// - `InferenceFolder` -- folds existential `InferenceVar` instances
///   that appear in the term being folded (use
///   `DefaultInferenceFolder` to ignore/forbid these altogether)
/// - `PlaceholderFolder` -- folds universal `Placeholder` instances
///   that appear in the term being folded (use
///   `DefaultPlaceholderFolder` to ignore/forbid these altogether)
///
/// To **apply** a folder, use the `Fold::fold_with` method, like so
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let x = x.fold_with(&mut folder, 0);
/// ```
